## Usage

The aim of the project is to create a website where the user can reach their team members by clicking on their email link, view the github page for the engineer, the school for the intern and the office number for the manager. The application starts by running `node index` in the terminal.

Once all the team members are added, the information is taken in an a new html file is generated in the dist folder.
