## Installation

In order to run the project locally, ensure that dependencies are installed by running:

`npm install`

<br />

## Usage

The aim of the application is to create a website where a user can reach team members by clicking on their email link, view the github page for the engineer, the school for the intern and the office number for the manager. Users can start the application by entering `node index` or `npm start` in the terminal. Once the application is running, the user enters the information based on the prompts. The first set of prompts are for the manager before the user is prompted to enter information for each team member they will be adding. Once all the team members are added, the information is taken in an a new html file is generated in the dist folder.
